# DAO Boards

The Boards compose the leadership structure already mentioned a few times up to this point. In this chapter, we present the set of boards, their goals and structure. A leadership structure is required to move things forward, indeed, initially the board members will be assigned by the founders, with the goal of driving the DAO adoption and development during the first year. Afterward, members will be democratically elected through the governance procedures.

Because we rely on leadership positions to guarantee efficiency, we support the Lazy Consensus over the quorum based approach. In this way, all actions can be disputed by DAO members, but at the same time, voting only takes place when there is disagreement.
Boards are not isolated groups operating independently, but they should participate into discussions and interact with other boards in order to support inclusion and diversity of ideas. The cooperation between multidisciplinary groups maximizes output and innovation.

At the same time, each board has a different scope and goals. For this reason, Board management is not fixed, but the number of members, the leaders and the activities planning are dynamically set based on the Board needs, as long as transparency principles are observed. Of course, the DAO governance is entitled at anytime to regulate Boards activities and challenge their actions.

## DAO Board

The main council in charge of managing DAO Governance and Treasury. Because of its centrality and influence, it is not weird to find leaders from other boards to have a seat in this committee. The DAO Board will drive governance and financial related proposals.

The DAO Board members are also the keepers of the founding DAO multi-signature address. This way, this council is in charge of managing the Treasury. The multi-sig is updated every time a member leaves the board or a new member joins, accordingly. Initially, the multi-sig address is composed by 5 addresses, but the size can change if the Board will require more members. The minimum amount of members, as well as multi-sig address, must always be 5, as well as the total amount must always be odd, in order to guarantee voting majority.

## Art Board

Arguably the most important council in the DAO, the Art Board will be composed by curators and artists, leading artistic related proposals. This committee will be in charge of guarantee a high quality standard for artists and works the DAO will be supporting.

## Strategy Board

Composed by international NFT strategists, this committee plays an important role to guarantee authority validation with communities and potential contributors outside the DAO. At the same time, this council covers an important role inside the governance, making sure the initiatives launched by the DAO, as well as supported projects, are properly perceived outside and potentially successful.

## Tech Board

A key aspect for the success of the project is to master the technical details involved into the initiatives and practical governance. This council makes sure the governance tools and supporting technologies work as expected, submitting improvement proposals in order to ease governance access and interface. Furthermore, this committee is the main through way for innovation proposals, that most of the time require a technical validation.
